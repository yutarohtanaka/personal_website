hi, you have found yourself on yutaro tanaka's homepage!

in the day time, i'm a computational biologist at the dana-farber cancer institute working with dr. riaz gillani in the van Allen and janeway labs. i'm broadly interested in using computational / data science tools and methods (eg. statistics, machine learning, language models) to better understand the biological mechanisms of pediatric rare diseases, and apply this understanding to develop novel therapic strategies for these conditions. some things i'd like to spend more time researching include trying to understand inter-patient variability in drug response, and understanding if/how language models can interpret biomedicine.
